// REQUIREMENTS 

// Your contract must include public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Symbol, Total Supply).
// Your contract must include a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint).
// You will have a create function that takes two parameters: an address and a value.
// The function increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance associated with that address by that amount.
// Your contract must include a destroy function, which works the opposite of the create function, as it will destroy tokens.
// It will take an address and value just like the create function. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
// Lastly, your destroy function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of the account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be destroyed.

    // public variables here

    // create function

        coinBalances[_addr] += _val;
